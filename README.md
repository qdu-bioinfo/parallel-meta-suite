# Introduction

Parallel-Meta Suite (PMS) is a visualized and interactive software package for microbiome analysis. It not only implements a comprehensive workflow that covers from sequence processing to chart plotting by state-of-art algorithms, but also provides an 
easy-to-use graphical interface for configuration and results interpretation, which is easy to startup for all-level users. The entire procedure of PMS has been optimized by parallel computing, enabling the rapid screening of thousands of samples. Both metagenomic shotgun sequences and 16S/18S/ITS rRNA amplicon sequences are accepted.

We strongly recommend that read this manually carefully before use Parallel-Meta Suite.

# System requirement and dependency
## Hardware requirements
PMS only requires a standard computer with sufficient RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For typical users, this would be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:
	
	RAM: 8+ GB
	CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core
    
## Software requirements

### OpenMP

OpenMP library is the C/C++ parallel computing library. Most Linux releases have OpenMP already been installed in the system. In Mac OS X, to install the compiler that supports OpenMP, we recommend using the Homebrew package manager:

	brew install gcc
	
### Rscript environment
For statistical analysis and pdf format output, PMS requires cran-R (http://cran.r-project.org/) 3.2 or higher for the execution of “.R” scripts. Then all packages could be automatically installed and updated by the PMS installer.
### Vsearch (included in the package)
Vsearch has been integrated in the package. If you want to install/update manually, please download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/vsearch/ and put the “vsearch” to $ParallelMETA/bin/.
### HMMER 3 (3.0 or higher, included in the package)
HMMER3 has been integrated in the package. If you want to install/update manually, please download from http://www.hmmer.org/download.html and put the “hmmsearch” to $ParallelMETA/bin/.


# Installation guide

**Due to size limitations of GitHub repositories, this repository does not include the reference database. Please use the following link to download PMS instead of directly cloning the repository.**

The latest released package(version 3.7.3):  

For Linux/Win WSL, the source code package is [here](http://bioinfo.single-cell.cn/Released_Software/parallel-meta/3.7.3/parallel-meta-suite-3.7.3-src.tar.gz).     

For MAC (Intel /M2/M3), the source code package is [here](http://bioinfo.single-cell.cn/Released_Software/parallel-meta/3.7.3/parallel-meta-suite-3.7.3-src-mac.tar.gz). 


## Automatic installation (recommended)

PMS provides a fully automatic installer for easy installation.

a. Extract the package:

	tar -xzvf parallel-meta-suite.tar.gz

b. Install
	
	cd parallel-meta-suite
	source install.sh


##### Tips for the automatic installation

1. Please **“cd parallel-meta-suite”** before run the automatic installer.
2. The automatic installer only configures the environment variables to the default configuration files of “\~/.bashrc” or “\~/.bash_profile”. If you want to configure the environment variables to other configuration file please use the manual installation.
3. If the automatic installer failed, PMS can still be installed manually by the following steps.

## Manual installation

If the automatic installer failed, PMS can still be installed manually.

a. Extract the package:

	tar –xzvf parallel-meta-suite.tar.gz

b. Configure the environment variables (default environment variable configuration file is located at “\~/.bashrc” or “\~/.bash_profile”)

	export ParallelMETA=Path to Parallel-Meta
	export PATH="$PATH:$ParallelMETA/bin"
	export PATH="$PATH:$ParallelMETA/Rscript"
    
c. Then, active the environment variables

	source ~/.bashrc

d. Install R packages
	
	Rscript $ParallelMETA/Rscript/config.R

e. Compile the source code:

	cd parallel-meta-suite
	make


# Typical usages
PMS provides a pipeline to automatically process the whole workflow.

<p align="center">Fig. 1. Three typical usages of PMS for different scenarios and platforms. (A) Local GUI configure and run. (B) Local GUI configure and remote run. (C) Command configure and run (for both locally and remotely). </p>


## GUI-based configuration and run in a local computer (Fig. 1 A)

#### Local GUI configuration

Local GUI-based usage is applicable with operating systems of Linux (GUI desktop installed), MAC OS, or Windows 10 (Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed)

a. Open the **"index.html"** page in the GUI configuration folder ($ParallelMETA/PMS-Config/index.html) by a web browser. 

Tip: You can also copy this folder to any other directory, e.g.

	cp -rf $ParallelMETA/PMS-Config ./


b. Adjust parameters or keep the default options (according to actual requirements)

c. Click the **“Generate”** button at the bottom of the page to get a command

d. Click the **“Copy”** button to copy it into clipboard

#### Local run

a. Paste this single-line command in the local terminal, and it will perfectly run Parallel-Meta Suite pipeline without other operations.

#### Local GUI view

a. Enter output directory

b. Open the visualized result viewer named as **"index.html"**

Tips:
1. All original results (e.g. relative abundance table, distance matrix, etc.) are kept for further in-depth data mining or meta-analysis. 
2. In addition, the analysis summary, work log and detailed step-by-step workflow script are also provided in the result folder. 

## Local GUI-based configuration and remote run in a server (Fig. 1 B)

#### Local GUI configure (for servers)

Usually, servers need remote login (e.g. via SSH) and only provide command-based terminal.  in the local computer to generate the command.

a. Download GUI configuration guide folder ($ParallelMETA/PMS-Config/) from the remote server, and open **"index.html"** in the folder by a web browser

b. Generate the command in the local computer as well as [local GUI Configuration](#local-gui-configuration)

#### Remote run
a. Paste and run the command in the terminal of remote server.

#### Local GUI view (for servers)
The results can also be transfer to the local computer for browsing as well as [Local GUI View](#local-gui-view).

## Command-based configuration and run (Fig. 1 C)
PMS also support command-based operations for non-GUI conditions, or experienced users. It is available via terminal either locally or remotely. Please run

	PM-pipeline -h

to check the parameters of the automatic pipeline.

# Example data in the package

PMS package provides a demo dataset with 20 16S rRNA V4 amplicon-based microbiomes sequenced by Illumina platform. You can copy the dataset to the current path by

	cp -rf $ParallelMETA/example ./


To run the demo, you can either
	
	cd example
	sh Readme

or use the [GUI-based configuration](#gui-based-configuration-and-run-in-a-local-computer-fig-1-a)

Then you can check the results by the [visualized viewer index.html](#local-gui-view) in the output folder by a webpage browser. 

We also provide a demo output for this example dataset. Click [here](http://bioinfo.single-cell.cn/Released_Software/parallel-meta/3.7.3/data/example.out.3.7.3.tar.gz) to download and check for details.

# Results interpretation

After using PM-pipeline, you might get the following folders/files in the output directory. In each directory, files/tables/figures are named with prefix “taxa” are taxonomy results, as well as “func” are metabolic functional results. PMS also provides an index page("index.html" in output directory) for results browsing.

### index.html (web page)

This is the index page to browse for results browsing. Users can open it by a webpage browser and view the detailed results by hyperlinks. 

### Sample_Views (dir)

This directory contains the visualized sample view in interactive pie charts across multiple samples.

### Abundance_Tables (dir)

This directory contains the relative abundance tables, absolute sequence count tables and bar charts of multiple samples on different taxonomical and functional levels.

### Distance_Matrix (dir)

This directory contains the pair-wised distance matrix of all input samples and unsupervised clustering results based on OTUs and KO profiles of multiple samples. Distances are computed based on Metastorms algorithm [Su, et al., Bioinformatics, 2012] and Hierarchical Metastorms algorithm [Zhang, et al., Bioinformatics Advances, 2021].
